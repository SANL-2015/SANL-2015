(0) Introduction
================

This file explains how to compile the benchmarks and run them.

The first step for all benchmarks is to set the ROOT variable in the 
'Makefile.config' file to the local path of your saml_benchmarks directory after
extraction.

(1) Liblock
===========

All benchmarks require the liblock.

Building the liblock
--------------------

1. Enter the liblock directory
2. Run 'make'

(2) Microbenchmark
==================

Building the microbenchmark
---------------------------

In order to build the microbenchmark, PAPI (http://icl.cs.utk.edu/papi/) must be 
installed on your system.

1. Enter the microbenchmark directory
2. Run 'make'

Running the microbenchmark
--------------------------

To run the latencies test: ./latencies.sh

The results will be output to the results/ directory. Alternatively, you can 
unpack the provided archive.

To plot the results:
Latencies: ./plot_draw_lan_intel.sh

(3) Phoenix 2
=============

1. Enter the phoenix/ directory.
2. Enter the phoenix-rcl/ subdirectory, and run 'make' to compile Phoenix 2.
3. Back in the phoenix/ directory, use 'run_all.sh' to run the benchmark. Other 
scripts are provided to plot graphs and to run the profiler on Phoenix 2.

(4) Memcached
=============

Building the client
-------------------

1. Enter the memcached-liblock/libmemcached-1.0.2 directory
2. For now, the core order is hard-coded in the libmemcached client. Please 
update it to reflect your architecture by modifying the contents of the 
cpu_map variable in the clients/memslap.cc file.
3. Run './configure'
4. Run 'make'

Building the server
-------------------

1. Enter the memcahed-liblock/memcached-1.4.6-patched directory
2. Run './configure'
3. Run 'make'

Running the microbenchmark
--------------------------

Just run the benchmark.sh script. Other scripts are provided to plot the graphs
(plot.sh). 

(5) Berkeley DB
===============

1. Enter the berkeleydb/ directory.
2. Run './generate.sh'
3. Use the benchmark.sh script to run the benchmark. Information about the
available parameters can be found in the script.

The script plot.sh can be used to plot the results.
